    <h3>Themes in <i>The Tempest</i></h3>
    <p>The great and striking
        <text-input></text-input> of this play is that its action lies wholly in the ideal world. It
        differs, therefore, from every other work of Shakespeare in the
        <text-input value="character"></text-input> of its mediation. Our poet, in most of his dramas, portrays the real
        world, and exhibits man as acting from clear
        <text-input value="conscious"></text-input> motives, and not from supernatural influences. But here he completely
        reverses his procedure; from beginning to end the chief instrumentalities of the poem are external; its conflicts
        and solutions are brought about by powers seemingly beyond human might and intelligence.
